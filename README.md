# GitHub Runners

## Notes:
- Instead of using submodules in a template repository, you can just point to a public repository (or private one with credentials), clone that repo into a subdirectory that is ignored, and execute code on the runner that outputs things in its parent directory.

## To do:
- [x] Run example runner
- [x] Run example runner and create a file
- [x] Run an example file and add it to the commit
- [x] Run the example and try doing that in Python
- [x] Make the python auditor into a submodule (automate submodule updates)
